My name is Alik Ulmasov. I do some hobby programming projects and show them off here.

By day, I work in the financial industry as a portfolio manager and quantitative researcher, mostly related to fixed income and derivatives (more details on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alikulmasov)). 

So far, my hobby programming projects have been related to data analysis stuff (using R and Python), but I am also interested in game design and Linux and plan to blog about that more.
